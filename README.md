**High-level shell scripting language, derived from Python**

I really like shell, and really dislike shell scripting syntax - so I made this.

Shed is a tool that allows you to **"use python as bash"** - directly call shell from python.
Works with functions, classes and so on - *no python functionality is removed*. 

For examples check `examples` directory.

> Work in progress. Currently this is only a **proof-of-concept** - expect bugs
